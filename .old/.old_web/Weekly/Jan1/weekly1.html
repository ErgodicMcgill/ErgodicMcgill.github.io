<h1 class="title">Weekly Recap 01-07</h1>
<p>
    Here is what I've been doing this week. <br>
    This page is in 3 parts: on the left are the results or definitions I have well absorbed, accompanied by a list of the books,
    articles, videos or whatever I have been looking at. On the right are more complete notes. The notes are not intended to be perfect (they may be unpolished).
    Rather, the goal is to keep track of what I learnt, and write down the important definitions and intresting results.

        <h2>Main Take-aways</h2>
        <p align="left">
            Complex Torii are in correspondence with elliptic curves via the map \( (\wp, \wp') \). <br>
            $$(\wp, \wp') : \mathbb{C}/\Lambda \to \text{Elliptic Curve}$$
            To a congruence subgroup \(\Gamma\) of \( SL_2(\mathbb{Z}) \), we associate a modular curve \(X(\Gamma)\). This is a Riemann surface (Diamond-Shurman chapter 2 for the charts).

        <p align="left">
            Numbers should not be thought of as objects in and of themselves (sets or whatever), but as an abstract progression. Any instance
            of such a class can equally well serve as a definition (e.g. \(2=\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\)), but the defining property of numbers is nothing more than the progression.
            But then, why distinguish "natural" numbers from integers so fervently? This amounts to saying that numbers form a free abelian group of rank 1. The group operation, in this case, is nothing more than the
            action of going up and down the progression. Using group theoretic language, the focus is put on the operation rather than on the set (we do not choose any particular set)
            which is perhaps what one really should care about when defining "numbers".
