<h2>Weekly recap</h2>
<p>
    <a href="weekly.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is what I've been doing this week. 
    <br> <br>
    This week, I have been reading Diamond-Shurman's book on modular form. I surveryed the whole thing, but thoroughly read chapters 1 to XXXX.<br>
    I leisurely read chapters of the book "Galois Cohomology" by Serre. Though I didn't spend enough serious time to understand deep things,
    it solidified my basic understanding of profinite groups, and of Homology. <br>
    I also have been reading a book on Philosophy of Math (a christmas gift from my brother). I read a chapter on the objects that are numbers. <br>
    Lastly, I helped my girlfriend learn how to code. I walked her through the basics, and (with my guidance here and there), she was able to code a basic game of Pong, and Flappy Bird!
